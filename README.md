## Brutal but useful advice

- React + Bootstrap is **good**, but **common**
- Your **booking logic** and **order flow** must be real
- If it’s static, say so — don’t lie in interviews

To make this **stand out**:
- Add form validation  
- Add booking confirmation state  
- Add cart summary for orders
